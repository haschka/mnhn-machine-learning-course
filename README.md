Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle (16 h course 8h Lectures 8h Exercises)

# Read the slides first:
[Classification](https://github.com/haschka/mnhn-machine-learning-course/blob/master/Classification.pdf)<br>
[Regression](https://github.com/haschka/mnhn-machine-learning-course/blob/master/Regression.pdf)<br>
[Dimensionality Reduction and DBSCAN](https://github.com/haschka/mnhn-machine-learning-course/blob/master/Dimensionality%20Reduction%20and%20DBSCAN.pdf)


# then go on to the ipython notebooks
1 - [Basic Python for Machine Learning - Pandas - Classification](https://github.com/haschka/mnhn-machine-learning-course/blob/master/Basic%20Python%20for%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Pandas%20-%20Classification.ipynb)<br>
2 - [The regression Problem - PCA and training a Regressor](https://github.com/haschka/mnhn-machine-learning-course/blob/master/The%20regression%20Problem%20-%20PCA%20and%20training%20a%20Regressor.ipynb)<br>
3 - [Unsupervised Learning - Clustering the nocturnal spring weather of France](https://github.com/haschka/mnhn-machine-learning-course/blob/master/Unsupervised%20Learning%20-%20Clustering%20the%20nocturnal%20spring%20weather%20of%20France.ipynb)

# Contents: 
The course features a basic introduction to python so that the students
can perform machine learning tasks with it. 
Further the basic usage of scikit-learn and how to validate
trained classifiers and regressors is tought as well as a short introduction 
into unsupervised learning
